== Admonition Test

We have found an issue with HubPress. The admonitions don't display in the live blog even though they are shown in the preview.

Now we added new tags, let's see if that makes a difference. Nope it doesn't.

[NOTE]
icon:fire[] this is a note


icon:heart[] Goes a long way


icon:exclamation-triangle[] Ignore at your peril!

[CAUTION]
A warning in disguise


WARNING: Do not go further!!
